# plagiarism-detector-project
My second AWS Sagemaker project as part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program from Udacity.

In this project, the task was to build a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.
